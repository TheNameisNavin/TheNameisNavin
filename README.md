I’m a dynamic and versatile professional with a unique blend of skills spanning full-stack web development, client-facing technical support, and cross-functional collaboration. With hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and delivering high-quality technical assistance to global clients, I operate comfortably across both engineering and customer success environments.

My expertise lies in crafting robust front-end interfaces with React and JavaScript, architecting server-side logic with Node.js and Python frameworks like Django and Flask, and integrating APIs and databases to deliver complete end-to-end solutions. I'm equally proficient in diagnosing complex technical issues, managing incident lifecycles, and working alongside engineering and DevOps teams to ensure timely resolution and platform stability.

Whether it's debugging REST APIs, optimizing database queries, implementing CI/CD pipelines, or leading customer onboarding and post-sales support, I bring a systems-thinking mindset and a problem-solving approach to everything I do. I thrive in collaborative environments where technology and user experience intersect—and I’m constantly seeking ways to innovate, automate, and improve.
